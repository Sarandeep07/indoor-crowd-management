Abstract
Efficient Indoor Crowd Management is a critical aspect of ensuring Public Safety and optimizing Crowd Control in various environments such as shopping malls, event venues, and transportation hubs. This project aims to develop a sophisticated Crowd Management System using YOLO (You Only Look Once) Object Detection algorithm and Flask Web Framework. The system utilizes Computer Vision techniques to detect and track individuals in real-time, enabling accurate crowd counting and monitoring. By providing real-time insights into crowd density and movement patterns, the system facilitates Efficient Crowd Management and enhances overall security measures.

The proposed system leverages the power of YOLO, an advanced object detection model, to accurately identify and track individuals within a video stream. By applying this algorithm to live camera feeds, the system is able to detect and count the number of people present in a given staircase. The captured data is then processed and displayed in a User-friendly Web Interface created using Flask, allowing authorized personnel to monitor crowd levels and make informed decisions regarding crowd control measures. Additionally, the system incorporates features like color-coded threshold alerts, where the display changes to red when the crowd density exceeds a predefined threshold, providing visual cues for immediate action and redirecting the crowd to the other staircase. By continuously refining the algorithm and expanding the system's capabilities, it has the potential to be deployed in various domains, ranging from public safety and security to crowd analytics for business optimization.

This combination of YOLO-based object detection and Flask web framework presents a powerful solution for Real-Time Crowd Monitoring and opens avenues for future research and advancements in the field.
